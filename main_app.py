    Welcome to your personal AI-powered Financial Analyst!
    
    This application helps you analyze your stock portfolio, get the latest news, and receive AI-driven insights.
    
    **Get started by following these simple steps:**
    1.  **Upload your Portfolio**: Use the uploader below to upload an Excel file (`.xlsx`) of your stock portfolio.
        The app supports both simple formats and Zerodha's holdings report.
    2.  **Analyze Your Portfolio**: Navigate to the `Portfolio Analysis` page to see a detailed breakdown of your holdings,
        including current values, profit/loss, and the latest news for each stock.
    3.  **Chat with the AI Analyst**: Go to the `AI Financial Analyst` page to ask questions about your portfolio,
        market trends, or specific stocks.
        
    **Note**: The app will automatically try to append `.NS` to stock symbols for compatibility with Indian market data.
